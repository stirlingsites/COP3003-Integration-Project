# COP3003-Integration-Project
I am creating a project based on a programming problem from the book Cracking the Coding Interview by Gayle Laakmann Mcdowell.
#
The author of this project is Stirling Sites.
#
This was project was created during my second year at Florida Gulf Coast University as a part of the programming 2 course.
#
For the first milestone of the project I solved the problem from Cracking the Coding Interview Chapter 3, Stacks and Queues #3.6
Problem: An animal shelter, which holds only dogs and cats, operates on a strictly "first in, first out" basis. People must adopt either the "oldest (based on arrival time) of all animals at the shelter, or they can select whether they would perfer a dog or a cat (and will recieve the oldest animal of that type. They cannot select which specific animal they would like. Create the data structures to maintain this system and implement operations such as enque, dequeAny, dequeDog, and dequeCat. You may use the biilt-in LinkedList data structure.
