# COP3003-Integration-Project
I am creating a project based on a programming problem from the book Cracking the Coding Interview by Gayle Laakmann Mcdowell.

The author of this project is Stirling Sites.

This was project was created during my second year at Florida Gulf Coast University as a part of the programming 2 course.
